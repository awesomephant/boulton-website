[...] The book comes in a utilitarian brown card sleeve, and a similar pared-down approach continues inside in the book. The reader opens the sleeve by pulling at a tab, which runs in perforated lines across both ends of the sleeve, similar to the opening of a cereal packet. This is the first decision the reader takes in encountering the book — which end is the top? The book has two spines, so it can be flipped over and the reader can start again — a book that promises only beginnings, and no ends. The two parts are similar but not the same, demanding closer inspection, disorienting the reader’s first impressions. — Reviewed by Riikka Kuittinen, Photomonitor, 2015.
